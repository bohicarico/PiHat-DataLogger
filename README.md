# RaspberryPiHat-datalogger

My name is Jacob Bendell, and Iâ€™m a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying Electrical Engineering.  I took this past year off from school to avoid online classes and intern at Amped Innovation, a start-up in the Bay Area that designs and builds solar home systems for people in developing countries.  There I worked on a Raspberry Pi project that collects and live-plots voltage, temperature, and battery capacity data.  Additionally, I created a Raspberry Pi hat circuit that enables these data collection features.  

The folder titled 'pythonscript' contains the files to run the data aquisition and live plotter features.  
The folder titled 'kicadhat' contains all the files and libraries for the data logger hat
